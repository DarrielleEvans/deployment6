<h1 align="center">BankApp Deployment: Terraform, Jenkins, & Amazon RDS<h1> 

# Purpose 
In the previous deployment, I deployed multiple versions of the banking application, with each version hosted in distinct subnets to minimize downtime risks. However, a significant drawback of this approach was that each application version operated with its own separate database. This architectural choice presented challenges, especially when considering the user experience across different availability zones. Customers accessing the application from various locations could encounter unsynchronized sessions, leading to inconsistencies and a poor user experience.

To address these issues, I have now deployed the application across two different regions, aiming to significantly reduce latency and enhance overall accessibility. More importantly, I have integrated a unified Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that connects with the application in each region. This modification ensures data synchronization across all sessions, regardless of the user's location. By implementing this change, we achieve data redundancy and maintain a consistent, seamless user experience.
